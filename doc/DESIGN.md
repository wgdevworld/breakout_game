# Breakout Design

## Woonggyu Jin

## Design Goals
* 

## High-Level Design
* Each object in the game (eg block, bouncer, paddle) as abstractions
* Most interaction between objects handled in Main class

## Assumptions or Simplifications
* Removing block simply moves it outside the screen to an arbitrarily set X-coordinate

## Changes from the Plan
* Implementation of "bad" block (refer to Idea #3 in section _Block Ideas_ in file _PLAN.md_)
did not happen because player has limited ability to control the ball (and avoid the bad block)

## How to Add New Levels
* Functionality not implemented
